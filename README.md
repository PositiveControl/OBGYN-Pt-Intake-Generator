patient_intake_template
=======================

## tPIG - Tiare's Patient Intake Generator

A quick and dirty web form for OB/GYNs to quickly input and generate standard patient admit info (template used by UNLV UMC resident OB/GYN physicians).
It's still very rough and not terribly pretty.  A work in (slow) progress.  Feel free to fork, hack, and submit a pull request.

Made for Dr. Tiare Evans, MD and team.
